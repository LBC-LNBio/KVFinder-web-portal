  KVFinder-web is an open-source web-based application of an
  updated version of parKVFinder software (v1.2.0) for
  cavity detection and characterization of any type of
  biomolecular structure. The characterization includes
  spatial, depth, constitutional and hydropathy
  characterization.


  The KVFinder-web has two independent components:
    - a RESTful web service: KVFinder-web service;
    - a graphical web portal: KVFinder-web portal.

  To broaden the range of possibilities for user
  interaction, we also provide additional client-side
  applications, that are:
    - a graphical PyMOL plugin: PyMOL KVFinder-web Tools;
keywords:
  - web-server
  - web-service
