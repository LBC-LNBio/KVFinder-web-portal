# KVFinder-web interface (KVshiny)

A Shiny App for interacting with KVFinder-web service.

The KVFinder-web interface (KVshiny), developed in R Shiny, delivers the major functionalities of the KVFinder-web service, where users can load a target biomolecule, adjust detection parameters, select run modes, and download and visualize results. The interface provides a simple and interactive way to analyze and visualize cavities. Volumes and areas are shown in an interactive table that can be downloaded in TOML format. A biomolecule viewer, powered by the NGL engine for R, displays the biomolecular structure with its cavities, which can be downloaded in PDB format, and allows various customizations, such as highlighting cavities and displaying interface residues surrounding them.
